    description: "A few weeks ago, Google created algorithmic feedback loops in the artificial neural networks it uses to power Google Photos' image-searching abilities. The result was a series of hallucinogenic still images that looked like a trippy mash-up between Neuromancer and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."

    description: "Google recently unleashed its image identification artificial neural network to the internet masses, and, predictably, the internet has quickly decided to turn it into psychedelic porn for robots. Google's DeepDream program takes images fed into the company's image recognition system and turns them into the most extreme version of that image imaginable."

    description: "I guess I should warn you that some of the images and gifs in this post are a bit ... disconcerting. Like this one: This image, which was recently on the front page of Reddit (to the internet's general horror), is the result of an experiment with Deep Dream, Google's neural network."

description: "Two weeks ago, Google engineers released the bizarre results of an artificial intelligence experiment, which saw photos interpreted and edited by the company's \"neural network\". The \"DeepDream\" software, based on code used to detect faces and other patterns in images, would find such a pattern, edit the image slightly to make it look more like that pattern, and repeat."
